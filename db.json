In a pioneering leap into the future, Robo-taxi is basically a self-driving or a driverless car which was launched recently in the market. After years of focused and intensive testing in the autonomous vehicles (SAE Level 4 or Level 5), today the companies have started to roll out such vehicles for e-hailing (on-demand mobility) service for regular commuters. The Robo-taxi generally eliminates the need of a human chauffeur, which costs a significant part of the operating costs. The Robo-taxi service could make shared mobility much more affordable to the commuters and is expected to boost the demand of Transportation-as-a-Service (TaaS) solutions, which will drive the growth of the Robo-taxi market over the analysed period.<br />\r\nOne of the most significantly adopted applications of the Robo-taxi include Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMoD) service, especially in the metro regions. Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMoD) is the solution that will drive the revolution towards self-driving cars. The AMoD is a technology comprising hardware, software, vehicle and its surrounding data that will improve the safety and economics of the ride. On an estimate, the Mobility on Demand (MoD) costs nearly US$ 2/mile, car ownership costs US$ 0.8/mile while AMoD costs US$ 0.3/mile. Hence, today, a number of companies are working on developing AMoD technology. In addition, increasing concern over road safety, emissions, reduction in road congestion and soaring demand for ride-hailing services are further expected to propel the growth of Robo-taxi market over the projection period.</p>", "tabel_of_content": "<h5>Detailed TOC of Global Robo-Taxi Market Insights: Insights and Forecast 2019-2025: Emphasis on Component (Camera, LiDAR, Radar, Ultrasonic Sensors), Level of Autonomy (Level 4, Level 5), Propulsion (Electric Robo-taxi, Hybrid Robo-taxi, Fuel Cell Robo-taxi), Vehicle</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>1.
